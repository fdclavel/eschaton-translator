"\n This translator is based on an extension of the Eschaton eldritch language created 
by Thunder Lotus Games for the 'Sundered' video game. It uses the same eldritch alphabet for 
written language, and a VERY loose method of pronunciation to allow a user to speak the 
language aloud. Some words follow written translations fairly closely, while many do not. 
This was done simply for ease of speech and to craft a more holistic and flavorful vocabulary. 

\nHave fun!  - Fred\n "
